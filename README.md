# Fake-News-Detection-
Detecting Fake News with Python and Machine Learning
The dataset and the jupyternotebook has been uploaded in the repository. 
This advanced python project of detecting fake news deals with fake and real news. Using sklearn, we build a TfidfVectorizer on our dataset. Then, we initialize a PassiveAggressive Classifier and fit the model. In the end, the accuracy score and the confusion matrix tell us how well our model fares.
In this ML project TfidfVectorize ,IDF (Inverse Document Frequency) and PassiveAggressiveClassifier is used TF(Term frequencey notes the time of a word appears in a document
higher frequency implies it appears more than other words.
IDF is words that appear many times but sometimes they maybe irrelevant.IDF measures the relavant terms in the entire documnent.
